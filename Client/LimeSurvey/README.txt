You will find 3 files in this archive.

Two PDFs are exports of the survey structure in human-readable formats (one for each language). The last file is the Survey structure (.lss), a dump of all the groups, questions, answers and conditions for the survey into a .LSS file (which is basically an XML file). This dump file can be used with the 'Import survey' feature when creating a new survey in Limesurvey (https://www.limesurvey.org).
